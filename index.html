    <h1>Story of Holi</h1>
    <p>
      The vibrant festival of Holi, also known as the Festival of Colors, has
      two main origin stories steeped in Hindu mythology. <h3>The Triumph of
        Good
        over Evil</h3> One story tells the tale of a tyrannical king named
      Hiranyakashyap. He was granted a boon that made him nearly invincible. In
      his arrogance, he demanded that only he be worshipped, forbidding the
      worship of any gods. However, his own son, Prahlad, remained a devout
      follower of Lord Vishnu. This enraged Hiranyakashyap, who tried numerous
      times to kill Prahlad, but the young prince remained unharmed each time.
      Finally, Hiranyakashyap enlisted his sister Holika, who possessed a cloak
      that could protect her from fire. Holika tricked Prahlad into sitting on a
      pyre with her while she wore the cloak. But as the fire raged, the cloak
      flew onto Prahlad, burning Holika instead. Prahlad emerged unscathed,
      symbolizing the victory of good over evil. Holi celebrations include a
      bonfire on the eve of the festival, called Holika Dahan. This bonfire
      represents the burning of Holika and the triumph of good.
    </p>

    <p><h3>The Playful Love of Radha and Krishna</h3>
      Another popular story centers around the playful love story of Radha and
      Krishna. Krishna, known for his dark blue skin, was insecure about his
      complexion compared to Radha's fair skin. According to legend, his mother
      suggested he playfully color Radha's face to match his. This act of love
      and the ensuing playful exchange of colors is believed to be the origin of
      the tradition of throwing colored powder and water during Holi.
      In regions associated with Radha and Krishna, Holi is a week-long
      celebration filled with music, dance, and the throwing of colors.
      Both stories highlight the essence of Holi: the triumph of good over evil,
      the importance of love and devotion, and the joyous celebration of
      spring.</p>

    <p>Holika Dahan (Burning of Holika)<br>
<br>
      This occurs on the night before the main Holi celebration.<br>
<br>
      People gather around bonfires to symbolize the burning of Holika, a demon<br>
      sister in Hindu mythology.<br>
<br>
      This ritual signifies the triumph of good over evil.<br>
<br>
      Offerings and prayers are sometimes made to Lord Vishnu for protection and<br>
      blessings.<br>
<br>
      Singing, dancing, and merriment are common around the bonfire.<br>
<br>
      Rangwali Holi (Festival of Colors)<br>
<br>
      This is the main day of Holi, often referred to as the<br>
      "festival of colors."<br>
<br>
      People throw vibrant colored powder (gulal) and water balloons at each<br>
      other.<br>
<br>
      This signifies the arrival of spring and new beginnings.<br>
<br>
      It's a time for letting go of inhibitions, fostering social bonding, and<br>
      creating a sense of community.<br>
<br>
      Traditional sweets and drinks like gujiya and thandai are enjoyed.<br>
<br>
      Visits to family and friends are customary, with old grievances set aside<br>
      to promote forgiveness and new beginnings.<br>
<br>
      These are the core rituals of Holi, but there can be regional variations<br>
      in how they're observed.<br>
